Right_Whale_VGG_net - tried to implement VGG_net with slight modification in architecture. In the code I'm loading all the input images in the starting which is causing RAM issue on my desktop.
Right_Whale_VGG_net_dyna - will have the same architecture as the previous one..the only difference is in this I will try to load image dynamically during the run time.
